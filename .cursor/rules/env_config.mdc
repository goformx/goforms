# Environment Configuration

> **CRITICAL NOTE**: The AI agent (me) CANNOT access, create, or modify `.env` files due to security restrictions. I can only provide guidance on what should be in the file and help debug configuration issues.

The application uses [envconfig](mdc:https:/github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig) to load environment variables. All configuration is defined in [internal/infrastructure/config/config.go](mdc:goforms/internal/infrastructure/config/config.go).

## Key Requirements

1. **Prefix**: All environment variables must be prefixed with `GOFORMS_`
2. **Config only**: All env values will be handled by our config package. Do not use os.Getenv() directly.
2. **Location**: `.env` file must be in the root directory
3. **Security**:
   - Session secret must be at least 32 characters
   - CSRF secret must be at least 32 characters
   - Use secure cookie settings in production
   - Configure proper session timeout
   - Set secure headers

## Debugging

When debugging configuration issues:
1. Trust that the developer has the .env in place
