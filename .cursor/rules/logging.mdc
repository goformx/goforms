# Logging Standards

## Overview
Logging is implemented using Uber's zap logger throughout the application. The logging configuration is managed through the middleware and infrastructure layers.

## Implementation
The main logging implementation is referenced in [internal/application/middleware/middleware.go](mdc:internal/application/middleware/middleware.go) and [internal/application/middleware/csrf.go](mdc:internal/application/middleware/csrf.go).

### Required Fields
All log entries should include:
- Request ID (when available)
- Component name
- Action being performed
- Relevant context data
- Error details (when applicable)

### Log Levels
Use appropriate log levels:
1. Debug: Detailed information for debugging
2. Info: General operational events
3. Warn: Potentially harmful situations
4. Error: Error events that might still allow the app to continue

### Middleware Logging
When implementing middleware logging:
1. Log middleware initialization
2. Log configuration details
3. Log security-related events
4. Include relevant request context
5. Use structured logging fields

### Error Logging
For error logging:
1. Include stack traces
2. Add context information
3. Use appropriate error levels
4. Don't log sensitive data
5. Include request IDs for correlation

### Performance Logging
When logging performance metrics:
1. Include timing information
2. Log slow operations
3. Monitor resource usage
4. Track middleware performance
5. Log rate limiting events
