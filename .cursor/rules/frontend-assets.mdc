# Frontend Asset Handling

- Frontend assets (JS, CSS) are built and served using Vite.
- In development mode, assets are loaded directly from the Vite dev server at `http://localhost:3000`.
- In production, asset paths are resolved using the Vite manifest file (`static/dist/.vite/manifest.json`).
- The Go backend uses [internal/infrastructure/web/assets.go](mdc:internal/infrastructure/web/assets.go) to read the manifest and provide hashed asset paths.
- Templates and components should use `web.GetAssetPath()` to reference assets, as seen in [internal/presentation/templates/layouts/layout.templ](mdc:internal/presentation/templates/layouts/layout.templ), [internal/presentation/components/login_form.templ](mdc:internal/presentation/components/login_form.templ), and [internal/presentation/components/signup_form.templ](mdc:internal/presentation/components/signup_form.templ).
- The main CSS entry point is [src/css/main.css](mdc:src/css/main.css), which imports all other CSS files and must have all `@import` statements at the top to avoid Vite warnings.
