# GoForms TypeScript TODO

## üî¥ CRITICAL FIXES (Implement Immediately)

### ‚úÖ Security Fix: Remove CSRF Token Logging
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **File**: `src/js/core/http-client.ts:25`
- **Issue**: CSRF tokens were being logged, exposing sensitive security tokens
- **Fix**: Replaced with secure status message

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Input Sanitization
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **File**: `src/js/features/forms/services/form-api-service.ts`
- **Issue**: Only string values were sanitized, leaving objects and arrays vulnerable
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive sanitization for all data types including arrays, objects, and nested structures

### ‚úÖ Fix Type Safety Issues
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **File**: `src/js/shared/types/form-types.ts`
- **Issue**: Heavy use of `any` types defeated TypeScript's type safety benefits
- **Fix**: Replaced with comprehensive, properly typed interfaces including:
  - `FormSchema` with proper component typing
  - `FormComponent` with detailed properties
  - `ValidationRule` with specific validation types
  - `FormMetadata` and `FormSettings` for configuration
  - `FormValidationResult` for structured validation responses

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Error Handling
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **File**: `src/js/core/errors/form-builder-error.ts`
- **Issue**: Generic error messages lost context and debugging information
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive error system with:
  - Proper error codes (`ErrorCode` enum)
  - Context preservation
  - Static factory methods for common error types
  - JSON serialization for logging
  - Type-safe error checking methods

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY FIXES (Next Sprint)

### ‚úÖ Memory Leak Prevention
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **File**: `src/js/features/forms/handlers/builder-events.ts`
- **Issue**: Event handlers not properly cleaned up, potentially causing memory leaks
- **Fix**: Implemented `BuilderEventManager` class with:
  - ‚úÖ Proper event listener cleanup using `AbortController`
  - ‚úÖ Timer cleanup for debounced functions
  - ‚úÖ Comprehensive cleanup method
  - ‚úÖ Automatic cleanup on page unload
  - ‚úÖ Statistics tracking for debugging
  - ‚úÖ Test file with usage examples (`builder-events.test.ts`)

### DOM Query Optimization
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **File**: `src/js/shared/utils/dom-utils.ts`
- **Issue**: Multiple DOM queries without caching
- **Fix**: Implemented `DOMCache` class with:
  - ‚úÖ Element caching with DOM presence verification
  - ‚úÖ Automatic cache invalidation
  - ‚úÖ Performance optimization for repeated queries

### Strongly Typed Events
- **Status**: PENDING
- **File**: `src/js/features/forms/services/form-event-service.ts`
- **Issue**: Event system uses untyped data, making it difficult to track event flow
- **Fix**: Implement strongly-typed event system with:
  - `FormEvents` interface defining all event types
  - Generic event handlers with proper typing
  - Type-safe event emission and handling

## üü† MEDIUM PRIORITY (Future Improvements)

### Dependency Injection Over Singletons
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Files**: Multiple service files
- **Issue**: Over-reliance on singletons makes testing difficult and creates tight coupling
- **Fix**: Consider dependency injection or factory patterns for better testability

### Enhanced State Management
- **Status**: PENDING
- **File**: `src/js/features/forms/state/form-state.ts`
- **Issue**: Basic key-value storage lacks type safety and reactivity
- **Fix**: Implement typed state management with:
  - Generic state class with proper typing
  - Subscription system for state changes
  - Automatic cleanup of subscriptions

### Performance Optimizations
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Files**: Multiple files
- **Issues**: 
  - Inefficient debouncing implementation
  - Schema validation without proper memoization
  - Bundle splitting opportunities
- **Fixes**:
  - Implement proper debouncing with cleanup
  - Add validation result caching
  - Optimize bundle splitting for better tree-shaking
